      <h1>What Makes NPC Interactions Engaging?</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          xGaming is a startup trying to develop tools to make game development
          easier. One problem in game development is generating new content --
          for example, creating new quests for the player, as distributed by
          NPCs. So, let's ask ourselves...
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
          How can we automatically generate immersive, quest-giving NPCs that feel like a real character in a real world?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>A rough progression of NPC depth</h2>
        <p>
          In classical RPGs, such as Skyrim, NPC quests and dialogue are
          pre-programmed. I propose that, instead, NPCs become more akin to real
          agents in the world, with goals, perception, memory, and possibly even
          emotions such that any conversation with an NPC is entirely dependent
          on the state of the world. This will do more to make them immersive
          than any amount of surface-level linguistic styling.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">These elements help give an NPC depth.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>NPC dialogue references the state of the world as it is</li>
          <li>
            NPCs have limited perception of the world; e.g. they 'learn'
            information from what the player or even other NPCs 'tell' them
          </li>
          <li>NPCs remember past events and reference them in dialogue</li>
          <li>
            NPCs have goals (i.e. a desired world state) and are happy/sad about
            it
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs ask players (or other NPCs?) to help them achieve their goal
            (i.e. quests)
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs treat players differently depending on how players' competence
            and attitude toward the NPC
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs can move through the world, which influences their perception
            of the world
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs can interact with the world in any way the player can, in order
            to achieve their goals
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs have simulated internal state (emotions), which gives them
            moods and multiple (and possibly conflicting) goals
          </li>
          <li>
            Different NPCs exhibit different emotional behaviors based on
            arbitrarily weighted 'personalities'
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs' internal stimuli are not perfectly attuned to their
            environment, making them irrational
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs carry emotional baggage, making them sensitive to certain
            stimuli
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>NPC depth, simplified</h2>
        <p>
          In other words, to maximize NPC immersion in dialogue, they should:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Perceive and remember the state of the world (imperfectly)</li>
          <li>
            Have goals and value judgements, which the player can help or hinder
          </li>
          <li>Have an internal emotional state and personality</li>
          <li>
            Be capable of interacting with the world (and other NPCs) any way
            the player can
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>How do we make a demo of this?</h2>
        <p>
          I have been tasked with creating a ROBLOX game to demonstrate the
          value of an AI dialogue system. There are significant constraints:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I don't quite know the specific boundaries of our current AI
            dialogue technology.
          </li>
          <li>I have eight weeks to make this demo game.</li>
          <li>
            Some NPC behaviors described above are beyond the limits of current
            technology and may be significantly difficult to create.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At the same time, xGaming will fail as a startup if it does not solve
          a sufficiently valuable (and presumably difficult) problem. Ideally
          there is a sweet spot that optimizes NPC immersion with the project
          constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also possible that a relatively low-immersion NPC demo may be
          successful! Regardless, I am inclined to make the NPCs as immersive as
          possible within my ability.
