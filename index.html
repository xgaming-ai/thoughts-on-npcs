      <h1>What Makes NPC Interactions Engaging?</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          xGaming is a startup trying to develop tools to make game development
          easier. One problem in game development is generating new content --
          for example, creating new quests for the player, as distributed by
          NPCs.
        </p>

          How can we automatically generate immersive NPCs that give players
          quests while feeling like a real character?
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>A rough progression of NPC depth</h2>
        <p>
          In classical RPGs, such as Skyrim, NPC quests and dialogue are
          pre-programmed. I propose that, instead, NPCs become more akin to real
          agents in the world, with goals, perception, memory, and possibly even
          emotions such that any conversation with an NPC is entirely dependent
          on the state of the world. This will do more to make them immersive
          than any amount of surface-level linguistic styling.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">These elements help give an NPC depth.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>NPC dialogue references the state of the world as it is</li>
          <li>
            NPCs have limited perception of the world; e.g. they 'learn'
            information from what the player or even other NPCs 'tell' them
          </li>
          <li>NPCs remember past events and reference them in dialogue</li>
          <li>
            NPCs have goals (i.e. a desired world state) and are happy/sad about
            it
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs ask players (or other NPCs?) to help them achieve their goal
            (i.e. quests)
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs can interact with the world in any way the player can, in order
            to achieve their goals
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs have simulated internal state (emotions), which gives them
            moods
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs' internal stimuli are not perfectly attuned to their
            environment, making them irrational
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs carry emotional baggage, making them sensitive to certain
            stimuli
          </li>
        </ol>
