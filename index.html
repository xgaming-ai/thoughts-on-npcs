      <h1>What Makes NPC Interactions Engaging?</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          xGaming is a startup trying to develop tools to make game development
          easier. One problem in game development is generating new content --
          for example, creating new quests for the player, as distributed by
          NPCs.

          How can we automatically generate immersive NPCs that give players
          quests while feeling like a real character?

        <h2>A rough progression of NPC depth</h2>
        <p class="italic">These elements help give an NPC depth.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Dialogue and quests are pre-programmed, such as in Skyrim</li>
          <li>NPC dialogue references the state of the world as it is</li>
          <li>
            NPCs have limited perception of the world; e.g. they 'learn'
            information from what the player or even other NPCs 'tell' them
          </li>
          <li>NPCs remember past events and reference them in dialogue</li>
          <li>
            NPCs have goals (i.e. a desired world state) and are happy/sad about
            it
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs ask players (or other NPCs?) to help them achieve their goal
            (i.e. quests)
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs can interact with the world in any way the player can, in order
            to achieve their goals
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs have simulated internal state (emotions), which gives them
            moods
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs' internal stimuli are not perfectly attuned to their
            environment, making them irrational
          </li>
          <li>
            NPCs carry emotional baggage, making them sensitive to certain
            stimuli
          </li>
        </ol>
